# Name: 
solveWork()

## Examples:
println(solveWork(3.74, 5.68, 0));  

## Description:
Calculates the amount of work based on the amount of force, the distance it moved, and the angle it went from originally.

## Syntax:
solveWork(force, dist, theta)

##Parameters: 
float force: the force of the object you are trying to calculate
float dist: the distance that the object moved from the original location
float theta: the angle that the object moved from

##Returns:
returns float

##Other notes:
float theta must be in degrees. Convert radians to degrees before using this function.
