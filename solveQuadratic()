# Name: 
solveQuadratic()

## Examples:
text(solveQuadratic(9, 0, -2, true), width/2, 400);  //the addition part of the plus-minus
text(solveQuadratic(9, 0, -2, false), width/2, 450);  //the subtraction part of the plus-minus

text(solveQuadratic(10, 3, 5, true), width/2, 500);  //no solution example
text(solveQuadratic(10, 3, 5, false), width/2, 550);  //no solution example

## Description:
Solves for x of a quadratic (parabola) when y equals 0. Uses the equation x = (-b +/- sqrt(sq(b) - 4*a*c)) / (2*a) .

## Syntax:
solveQuadratic(a, b, c, plus)

##Parameters: 
float a: the coefficient of x*sq(x) in a*sq(x) + b*x + c
float b: the coefficient of x in a*sq(x) + b*x + c
float c: the constant c from a*sq(x) + b*x + c 
boolean plus: determines how the function will calculate. If plus is true, it will add in the plus-minus part of the quadratic equation. If plus is false, it will subtract in the plus-minus part of the quadratic equation.

##Returns:
returns float

##Other notes:
If the return float value of solveQuadratic is drawn, it may draw squares. These squares mean that there is no solution as the answer is an imaginary number. The console will show the message "The squares mean that this has no solution." in the event of confusion.
